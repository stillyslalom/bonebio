Brep format
brep: 2-D geometry Structure with vertices and segments
brep.vertices = (2,N) matrix
includes end points, centers of arcs and circles, and a single point on a circle

brep.segments = (4,M) matrix
Each column denotes a boundary segment with 4 values
The columns are as follows
A. For line segments
[1 startVertex endVertex 0 ]';

B. For partial arcs
[2 startVertex endVertex centerVertex]';
centerVertex is +ve if clockwise and -negative if ccw

C: Connector lines (between outer and inner loops)
[-1 startVertex endVertex 0 ]';
